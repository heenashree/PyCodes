If you want to search through an unsorted array or to find the first occurrence of a search variable, the best option is linear search.
If you want to search through a sorted array, there are many options of which the simplest and fastest method is binary search.
If you have a sorted array that you want to search through without using the division operator, you can use either jump search or Fibonacci search.
If you know that the element you're searching for is likely to be closer to the start of the array, you can use exponential search.
If your sorted array is also uniformly distributed, the fastest and most efficient search algorithm to use would be interpolation search.
